# Employee Management Dashboard Project

## Overview

This project is an Employee Management Dashboard that provides a user interface to dynamically manage employee information in a table. Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records through an interactive web application. The skills utilized in this project include JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

## Features

- **Create Employee:** Add new employee details to the table dynamically.
- **Read Employee:** View employee information in a dynamic table format.
- **Update Employee:** Modify existing employee details directly from the dashboard.
- **Delete Employee:** Remove employee records from the table with ease.

## Issues Faced and Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Data Storage and Retrieval in Local Storage**

**Issue:** Storing and retrieving complex data structures like employee records in local storage required careful handling.

**Solution:** Proper serialization and deserialization were implemented using `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` to convert data between string and object formats.

### 2. **Key-Value Pair Management**

**Issue:** Effective management of keys for different records and ensuring unique identifiers for each employee were crucial to avoid data conflicts.

**Solution:** Unique IDs were assigned to each employee record to ensure distinct key-value pairs in local storage.

### 3. **Data Synchronization**

**Issue:** Keeping the local storage data in sync with the application's current state presented challenges, especially when changes were made in the application.

**Solution:** Event listeners and handlers were implemented to trigger updates in local storage whenever changes occurred in the application.
